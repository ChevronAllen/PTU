# PTU-1.05 Roll20 Character Sheet
This sheet based on the old Roll20 sheet. It is partially compatible with the old sheets, if you upgrade to this sheet you will need to re-enter Moves, Features and Edges. The original sheet had many visual bugs which differed from browser to browser, originally my aim was to fix these css errors but slowly transformed into a new cleaner sheet.
This sheet is designed to have minimal automation but provide a few quality of life features. Such as:
  Separate 'Moves Known' and 'Move List' sections
  Additional Bonus fields and global modifier fields
  Damage calculation Macro
  AP tracker
  Notes page
  Background tracker
Many of these sections/fields are also collapsable
